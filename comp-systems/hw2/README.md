## Intro to Computer Systems - Homework 2


**Compile All**: `make all`

### Problem 1 - The Sieve of Eratosthenes

**compilation**: `make p1`

**run**: `./sieve.out {NUM}`

where `{NUM}` is a positive integer (You can try negatives or non-integers if you want)

You can also try

        make NUM=100 test

And try replacing `100` with other arguments.

### Problem 2 - Code Directly from Assignment

        ./p2.out

### Problem 3 - Bank Simulation

**Run**

        ./bank.out [empty_seats] [total_customers]

Run the program to perform a simulation using the implementation

### Problem 4 - Teacher, Classroom and Parent Semaphore Simulation

Run the teacher and child simulation by running `classroom.out`

        ./classroom.out
