# READ ME FIRST

Hey there, it looks like you've stumbled upon my code archive for the majority of my undergrad classes at Rutgers.

- If you're a student please read the following [STUDENT NOTICE](#student-notice)
- If you're a professor, instructor, or class admin you may want to read the [INSTRUCTOR NOTICE](#instructor-notice)

# STUDENT NOTICE


By reading this notice you acknowledge that copying any code from this repository
for a class assignment, homework, exam, or otherwise constitutes plagiarism. My
previous assignments may be helpful as a reference for completing your projects
but under **NO CIRCUMSTANCES** should code be copied from any file within this repository.

Another disclaimer: The code here is not perfect, I have mangled some random files
which intentionally break the implementation of some of the more prolific projects
that students are typically assigned in the classes I took. 


# INSTRUCTOR NOTICE

If you're a professor, instructor, teacher, or otherwise that believes students of his
or her class may be plagiarigizng from this repository you may
[create an issue](https://github.com/zacblanco/issues/new) where we can discuss possible
solutions.

I have published this repository because I don't want to destroy the hundreds of hours
of work I collectively spent completing the many assignments within this repository.
GitHub was terminating my education discount which allowed me to keep this repository
private for the time between 2014-2018.
